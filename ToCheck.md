- Understand where the taus are lost in the analysis selection.
- Data-MC comparison in side variables (B pT, muon pT etc etc)
- What if I use the probe muons in the analysis? Probably I can go lower in the pT of the muon, do I gain anything?

There are some events in which the B muon is soft and the TrgMu is something else (plot the MC_mu_pt spectrum and try to get where the Muons below generation thr are coming form)
