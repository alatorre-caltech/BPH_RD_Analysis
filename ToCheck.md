- Understand where the taus are lost in the analysis selection.
- Understand fully wha't the proper approximation to do to reconstruct the B pT
- Cut B kinematics to reduce the effect of the approximation.
- Startd data-MC comparison in side variables (B pT, muon pT etc etc)

There are some events in which the B muon is soft and the TrgMu is something else (plot the MC_mu_pt spectrum and try to get where the Muons below generation thr are coming form)
