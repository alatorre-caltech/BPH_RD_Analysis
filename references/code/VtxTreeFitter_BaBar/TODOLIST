- revise RecoPhoton such that it can deal with Klongs --> no energy constraint

- think about what happens to bremstrahlung: e+ -> e+ gamma

- implement sparse matrices

- make a head-of-tree class, that derives from InternalParticle and is
  base for InteractionPoint.

- make charged particles curve (now only done for charged tracks) -->
not difficult: need only change ParticleBase::filterGeoConstraint.


[- move 'getFitted' from VtkVertex into ParticleBase]
[- move 'p4WErr'    from VtkVertex into ParticleBase (remove 'momIndex' from BeamSpot)]
[- move projection of kinematic constraint into daughter]

Things that need to be changed in VtxFitter:

- my fit fails if you try to vertex a pi0 without further constraints

- you cannot see if a bta-composite has seen a mass constraint or not;
this is a problem for the fit
